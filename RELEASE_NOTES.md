This branch receives bug fixes as they arrive, during 12 months at least.

Version 16.12
=============

This release represents one year of contributions. It's a HUGE one !  
Major highlights include:
 * a brand new console to manage efficiently users, orgs and roles
 * an atlas webapp, which allows users to have features from a layer printed as multipage PDF
 * many new features in our power viewer: map contexts manager, buffer, styling of vector features, new addons...
 * docker as prefered, streamlined deployment procedure
 * [sdi consistence check](https://github.com/georchestra/sdi-consistence-check), a new project whose aim is to check links between data and metadata in a SDI.

Many thanks to those who made it possible, either through funding, or patches !

Version 15.06
=============

This release brings several key enhancements:
 * support for the newer Debian 8 "Jessie", including tomcat 7, 8 & apache 2.4,
 * standard geoserver artifacts can now be used instead of the "geOrchestra flavoured geoserver",
 * [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/georchestra/georchestra) service integration, with improved test coverage,
 * lighter artifacts.

Other enhancements include:
 * mapfishapp: redirect to iD as OSM editor - see [#992](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/992),
 * mapfishapp: gml & kml export of results - see [#995](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/995),
 * mapfishapp: the admin may restrict all metadata searches to a specific extent, while the user may now restrict his search to the current map extent - see [#964](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/964),
 * mapfishapp: added possibility to filter visible features in POSTed layers with CQL - see [#921](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/921),
 * proxy: intercepts "connection refused" errors - see [#963](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/963),
 * doc: added SASL configuration for remote AD - see [#958](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/pull/958).

Full list of issues on GitHub issue tracker, tagged with milestone [15.06](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues?q=milestone%3A15.06).

Please note that:
 * the protocol between the security proxy and the apps was slightly modified as a result of [#920](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/920). This means that the proxy and webapps from this release are not backward-compatible: you cannot use mapfishapp from 15.06 with a 14.12 security-proxy.
 * geOrchestra 14.01 is not supported anymore.

Many thanks to all contributors for this great release !

Version 13.06
==============

This release was supported by the French GeoPicardie, GeoBretagne and CIGALsace projects, the GIP ATGeRi and individual contributors.

New features:
 * geoserver: updated to 2.3.2,
 * geoserver: patched to include ScaleHint (WMS 1.1.x) and Min/MaxScaleDenominator (WMS 1.3.0) in the capabilities documents, according to the default layer SLD. The patched was accepted in GeoServer master, see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS-572

Enhancements:
 * the header is now part of the static module, and all webapps make use of it. As a result, requests to static pass through the security-proxy,
 * the header height can be set across all applications by the way of a unique shared maven filter,
 * mapfishapp: the CSW querier filters results on type = dataset OR series,
 * extractorapp: supported output formats combos made configurable, ECW output format expunged by default,
 * the template config was slimmed down: files where default values are suitable for most deployments were moved to config/defaults,
 * the documentation was improved ([mapfishapp](mapfishapp/README.md#feature-editor), [install](INSTALL.md), [manage configs](README.md#how-to-customize-)),
 * we now have CI on JS files syntax with Travis !

Bug fixes:
 * fixed the ability to turn off the downloadform with shared.downloadform.activated,
 * mapfishapp: referentials search now sends the map srs in the WFS query to allow feature reprojection,
 * mapfishapp: fixed incorrect thumbnail URLs in CSW querier,
 * mapfishapp: fixed misaligned thumbnail in CSW querier,
 * mapfishapp: fixed window + grid problems on service opening, see [issue 109](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/109),
 * mapfishapp: fixed error in GEOR.ows.hydrateLayerRecord when falling back to main service,
 * mapfishapp: fixed links to MD sheet, see [issue 110](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/110),
 * mapfishapp: fixed broken legend after styling, see [issue 107](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/issues/107),
