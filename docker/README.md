# Docker

Are you looking for a way to run geOrchestra on Docker ?
Please read the dedicated [how-to](https://github.com/georchestra/docker).

## Building your own docker images for geOrchestra

To build all geOrchestra docker images, including complementary services (ssh, smtp, webmail), just type:
```
make docker-build
```

Other useful makefile targets:
 * `docker-build-georchestra`: builds core geOrchestra images, including database & ldap
 * `docker-build-geoserver-geofence`: builds `georchestra/geoserver:geofence`
 * `docker-build-dev`: builds non-core geOrchestra images (ssh, smtp, webmail)
 * `docker-build-database`: builds `georchestra/database`
 * `docker-build-ldap`: builds `georchestra/ldap`
 * `docker-build-gn3`: builds `georchestra/geonetwork`
 * `docker-build-geoserver`: builds `georchestra/geoserver`
 * `docker-clean-volumes`: stops services and erases volumes (use with caution !)
 * `docker-clean-images`: stops services and removes images 
 * `docker-clean-all`: removes images and volumes (use with caution !)


Note: usually, you don't have to build these images by yourself, since it is already taken care of by our CI, which pushes the latest images to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/georchestra/).
